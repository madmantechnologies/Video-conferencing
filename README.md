# Video-conferencing
Video conferencing is a technology that allows users in various locations to engage with each other. Many industries have seen a revolution as a result of this technology. The majority of organisations are actively utilising this technology since it provides convenience, saves time and money, and eliminates the need for extra trip effort. Video conferencing technology can be used for a variety of purposes, including company meetings, job training sessions, and addressing board members. Financial advisers, therapists, tutors, and lawyers, for example, were able to meet with their clients and conduct one-on-one sessions using video conferencing. Thanks to ever-increasing video conferencing technology, more fields, such as defence, education, healthcare, public and private sectors, have embraced video conferencing technology as a means of enhancing working and learning efficiency and staying ahead of their competition.
